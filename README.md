# Baltimore-Newton-Incarceration-Rate
Comparing incarceration rate in Baltimore, MD and Newton, MA
## Background
The United States has one of the highest incarceration rate in the world. In the [article published by Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/01/16/percent-incarcerated/#:~:text=Nearly%20one%20out%20of%20every,in%20a%20prison%20or%20jail.&text=We're%20often%20asked%20what,state%20prison%20or%20local%20jail.), it estimated that around 0.7% of the US population or 698 per 100,000 people are currently imprisoned. It is essential to explore the reasons why so many people are incarcerated to create better solutions to fix the issues. We will take a look at the open data from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/) and compare the incarceration rates at Baltimore, MD and Newton Center, MA in relation to parents income. A city in Massachusetts was chosen because it has one of the lowest incarceration rates in the US. It would be worthwhile to explore the relationship between parents income and incarceration rate at cities with medium-high incarceration rate and low incarceration rate.
## Business Question
